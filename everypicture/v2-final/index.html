            <h2>*Anastasia*</h2>
            <p>to this day, this movie's soundcrack still makes me cry and it relives my childhood nostalgia. its my favorite movie. i remember always watching and playing this movie on my dvd player during roadtrips and skipping to the end credits to listen to the song and constantly replay it. the disc comes with a lil feature where you can follow the artists of the movie and draw the main character which is pretty cool. </p>
