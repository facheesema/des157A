            It is without question, that if we ever want users to do anything like fill out forms, we designers must, for the love of god, do everything in our capacity to design user friendly experiences. If we don't take into account simple best practices, i fear we will never go anywhere. So let me explain to you some totally usable techniques and applications and why they matter in the realm of something as boring as filling out forms.

            Forms are boring. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it. Knowing this, asking boring, complicated, useless, irrelevant questions won't make anyone happy. We're trying to get a move on, so let's keep things simple! Ask relevant, juicy, straight to the point stuff. On that note, we don't wanna bombard the poor folk with all these questions ya know? Let's break them up in eatable pieces so they don't throw up and clock out.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's get the facts straight: for best form practices, avoid all confusion. Be clear, succinct, and label things. We're all about clarity in this establishment, with mindful placeholders where necessary. Look at Duolingo for example! They have a bar showing you how close you are at completing the form, include fun and responsive graphics, and their questions go straight to the point.
