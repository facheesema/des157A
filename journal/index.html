            Let's talk overlays everyone. Personally, i love a good overlay...did you catch that? <em>good overlays</em>. NOT bad overlays. There's a difference, and i'm going to make sure you know by the time i finish this word vomit okay. i'll try my worst, and give it my weakest. 
        </p>

        <p>
            First things first: do you even know what an overlay is anyways? yeah, i didn't think so (pretend you don't know if you do, and if you dont know, thats even better). As the author of the article i linked at the top put it, An oVeRlAy "refers to a content box that is displayed on top of another page". It's this little square or rectangular box that appears over your screen that has info...think of those boring and absolutely waste of space ads that pop up after opening a website trying to make you subscribe to their newsletter nobody opens. i mean who even checks their email anymore (i do, and i think thats a sign of me getting older im so sad...not bc im getting older but that i shouldn't even have an email account to worry about like i could totally talk about that but thats not the goal of this)
        </p>

        <p>
            Great! You know what overlays are. But now it's time to get serious. Overlays are a gift, a gift that should be given at special moments ya know? That being said, don't waste it, and don't abuse it. As the article notes, you need to handle overlays with care, and not jam-pack them with so much info that you might as well make a new page instead of an overlay. Know your W's: 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Who</strong> is the target audience?</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> action is the user supposed to take?</li>
                <li><strong>When</strong> will the overlay appear, and will it be an interruption?</li>
                <li><strong>Where</strong> will the overlay appear on the page?</li>
                <li><strong>Why</strong> does this need to be in an overlay instead of within a page?</li>
            </ul>

            These are all the factors that need to be taken into account. I, no, the <em>public</em> begs you, don't give gifts away like some medicore clown, they become less special.

            It is without question, that if we ever want users to do anything like fill out forms, we designers must, for the love of god, do everything in our capacity to design user friendly experiences. If we don't take into account simple best practices, i fear we will never go anywhere. So let me explain to you some totally usable techniques and applications and why they matter in the realm of something as boring as filling out forms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Forms are boring. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it. Knowing this, asking boring, complicated, useless, irrelevant questions won't make anyone happy. We're trying to get a move on, so let's keep things simple! Ask relevant, juicy, straight to the point stuff. On that note, we don't wanna bombard the poor folk with all these questions ya know? Let's break them up in eatable pieces so they don't throw up and clock out.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's get the facts straight: for best form practices, avoid all confusion. Be clear, succinct, and label things. We're all about clarity in this establishment, with mindful placeholders where necessary. Look at Duolingo for example! They have a bar showing you how close you are at completing the form, include fun and responsive graphics, and their questions go straight to the point.
